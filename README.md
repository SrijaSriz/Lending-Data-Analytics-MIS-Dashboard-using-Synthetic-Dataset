Synthetic Lending Dataset Project for MIS Analysis üìà
This project's goal is to create a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world lending operations. This dataset serves as a foundation for building dashboards, analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs), and deriving insights to support decision-making for Management Information Systems (MIS) Analyst roles. The project helps in practicing reporting, dashboarding, and analytical tasks common to an MIS Analyst's responsibilities.


Data Dictionary and Engineering üõ†Ô∏è
The dataset simulates common lending operation data, including customer behavior, loan performance, repayment trends, and risk indicators.

Feature Engineering
New variables were created to enhance predictive power. These include:


Debt-to-Income Ratio: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the applicant's income, which helps assess repayment capacity.


EMI Burden: The proportion of EMI to income, indicating monthly affordability stress.


Payment Progress: The percentage of EMIs paid relative to the total tenure, which highlights repayment discipline.


Application-to-Disbursal Days: The processing time between the loan application and disbursal, which can capture operational or fraud-related delays.


Loan-to-Tenure Ratio: A normalized monthly loan burden.


Categorical Encoding: Conversion of categorical features like Employment_Type, Loan_Type, and Approval_Status into machine-readable numeric variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Insights üìä
The EDA process involved checking for missing values and duplicates and creating visualizations to gain basic insights.


Key Findings

Correlation Analysis: Numerical variables have low-to-moderate correlations, with a moderate positive relationship between Loan_Amount and Income. This suggests that higher-income applicants tend to apply for larger loans.



Distributions & Outliers: Variables like Income and Loan_Amount are right-skewed and contain notable outliers that may affect model performance. * 

Categorical Variables & Loan Approval: Salaried applicants have a higher approval rate than self-employed applicants.


Default Risk Indicators: Self-employed applicants show a higher likelihood of default compared to salaried ones. Younger applicants (<30) and older applicants (>55) show slightly higher default risks, whereas mid-age groups (30‚Äì45) appear more stable.


Predictive Modeling ü§ñ
Machine learning models were applied to predict loan default probability. The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using stratified sampling to maintain class balance. 


StandardScaler was used for feature normalization.

Models and Results
The models were evaluated using a confusion matrix, classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score), and ROC-AUC score.


Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 99.7% and a perfect ROC-AUC score of 1.0, showing excellent separation between defaulters and non-defaulters.



Decision Tree Classifier: Also reached 99.7% accuracy, but with a slightly lower ROC-AUC of 0.997. There were minor misclassifications, including 1 false positive and 2 false negatives.




Random Forest Classifier: This model was the strongest, achieving a perfect 100% accuracy and an ROC-AUC score of 1.0. It effectively eliminated misclassifications by combining multiple trees.
